          <p>With the recent outbreak of Coronavirus and the unprecedented social distancing efforts of communities around the world to slow its spread, many of us&mdash;for better or worse&mdash;find ourselves working from home for an extended period of time.</p>

          <p>While some rejoice at the idea of staying home from work, it's important to keep the long haul in mind. What begins as excitement can eventually turn into dread as work and home blend together. Though it seems counterintuitive, working from home without the right mindset can negatively impact your work-life balance.</p>

          <p>Here are some tips that I use to stay happy and productive working from home. The specific logistics of working from home varies for everyone, so this is kept at a fairly high level.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">1. Designate your home workspace</h2>

          <p>Try to find a place in your home that is comfortable for a full day's worth of work. A desk or table is encouraged, along with a chair that you're comfortable sitting in for a long period of time. Other things to look for are ample lighting and separation from distractions.</p>

          <p>Resist the urge to work from your couch, or worse yet, your bed. A key part of making working from home <em>work</em> in the long haul is keeping your work space separate from your living and sleeping spaces.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Keeping your workspace tidy can also improve productivity and increase creativity and energy</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">2. Get dressed</h2>

          <p>I know. It sounds like I'm taking away the biggest perk of working from home. But hear me out. The routine of getting dressed in the morning before work helps delineate your day. When the work clothes are on, it's time for work. At the end of the day, change back into those comfy clothes.</p>

          <p>But rejoice: you don't have to dress up as much as you do going into work. Casual Friday can be everyday when working from home.</p>

          <p>This is especially important considering video conferencing. Being dressed can make you feel (more) comfortable with turning on your webcam and adding a personal touch to otherwise impersonal teleconferences.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">3. Chat with your colleagues</h2>

          <p>After a while, working from home can start to feel isolating. It's easy to overlook if you work in the office regularly, but those face-to-face interactions you have with your colleagues really amount to something.</p>

          <p>It takes some extra effort to keep this up when working remotely, but it's well worth it. Use instant messaging, texting, or video conferencing just to have a chat with at least one coworker in the day. It keeps things human and, more importantly, everyone connected.</p>

          <p>This goes for work-related subject matter as well. Err on the side of over-sharing with your team members with things like status reports and updates. As much as you can, project to others that you are available to be reached out to. Maybe it's just by setting your instant messaging status to &quot;At my desk&mdash;chat me!&quot;</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">4. Take short walks</h2>

          <p>Depending on your workplace, you may walk more steps than you realize over the course of a workday at the office. When working from home, it's important (as it is in <em>any</em> work environment) to take breaks periodically. If possible, take a short walk outside to take some time away from your screen and reenergize.</p>

          <p>Though it may seem you might get less work done, you'll likely find yourself more productive when you come back from that walk.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">If your kids are also home with you, take them with you! They need fresh air, too.</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">5. Log off</h2>

          <p>When working from home, it's easy to lose track of time. Having your living and work spaces colocated also can make it harder to unplug from work at the end of the day.</p>

          <p>Try to keep your work schedule similar to what it was in the office. When it's time to &quot;go home&quot; at the end of the day, log off, clean up your workspace, and change out of those work clothes. If you have a door to your work area, consider shutting it. Have a good night!</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Enjoy!</h2>

          <p>These are challenging times that have brought us into our home offices to work. But keep these silver linings in mind:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No commuting</li>
            <li>Homemade lunch</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Stay safe and healthy, everyone. See you back at the office soon.</p>
